You might want to do a couple of things to get started.

1. Migrate the city database tables and test out the example city database 
   using the following rake task:

   rake metropoli:seed

2. Start relating your models to the city database with the generator:

   rails generate metropoli [model] [city | state | country] [options]
		
3. (If you'd like to use jquery) Get Jquery and JQuery UI Autocomplete to use
   the built in autocomplete feature. You can get both at:

	http://jquery.com/
	http://jqueryui.com/
